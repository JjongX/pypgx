Introduction
============

This section describes the application programming interface (API) for PyPGx.

Below is the list of submodules available in the API:

- **core** : The core submodule is the main suite of tools for PGx research.
- **genotype** : The genotype submodule is a suite of tools for accurately predicting genotype calls.
- **pipeline** : The pipeline submodule is used to provide convenient methods that combine multiple PyPGx actions and automatically handle semantic types.
- **plot** : The plot submodule is used to plot various kinds of profiles such as read depth, copy number, and allele fraction.
- **utils** : The utils submodule contains main actions of PyPGx.


For getting help on a specific submodule (e.g. utils):

.. code:: python3

   from pypgx.api import utils
   help(utils)
