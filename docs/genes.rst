CYP2D6
======

Some alleles in PharmVar are not called by PyPGx because one or more of their variants are likely an artifact. These alleles are listed in below table. If a variant has been found in gnomAD, I will provide their link so you can look at those (e.g. allele imbalance for heterozygotes).
