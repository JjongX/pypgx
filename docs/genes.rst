CYP2D6
======

Some alleles in PharmVar will not be called by PyPGx because one or more of their variants are likely an artifact (e.g. read misalignment). Those alleles are listed in below table. If problematic variants are present in gnomAD, their links are provided so that you can look at filtering status, allele imbalance for heterozygotes, etc.
