Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)
==========================================================

The `Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)
<https://cpicpgx.org/>`__ is an international consortium whose primary goal
is to facilitate use of PGx tests for patient care by creating, curating, and
posting freely available, peer-reviewed, evidence-based, updatable, and
detailed gene/drug clinical practice guidelines.

Pharmacogenomics (PGx)
======================

According to this PharmGKB `post <https://www.pharmgkb.org/page/faqs#what-
is-the-difference-between-pharmacogenetics-and-pharmacogenomics>`__:

  In general pharmacogenetics usually refers to how variation in one single
  gene influences the response to a single drug. Pharmacogenomics is a
  broader term, which studies how all of the genes (the genome) can
  influence responses to drugs. However, these terms are often used
  interchangeably.
