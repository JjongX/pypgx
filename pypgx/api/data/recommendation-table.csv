desipramine,CYP2D6,Ultrarapid Metabolizer,None,None,"Avoid tricyclic use due to potential lack of efficacy. Consider alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2D6. If a TCA is warranted, consider titrating to a higher target dose (compared to normal metabolizers).

atomoxetine,CYP2D6,Ultrarapid Metabolizer,None,None,"Initiate with a dose of 40 mg/day and increase to 80 mg/day after 3 days. If no clinical response and in the absence of adverse events after 2 weeks, consider increasing dose to 100 mg/day. If no clinical response observed after 2 weeks, consider obtaining a peak plasma concentration (1 to 2 hours after dose administered). If <200 ng/mL, consider a proportional increase in dose to approach 400 ng/mL. Dosages greater than 100 mg/day may be needed to achieve target concentrations."
